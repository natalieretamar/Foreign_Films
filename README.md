#Foreign Film (Luther Project)

A small independent movie theatre owner is eager to present a foreign film at his venue. 
He is apprehensive because he has never shown a foreign film and is worried about revenue. Will his clients be excited or will he suffer a financial loss? 

My goal is to predict which type of foreign film will yield the greatest revenue. 

Data from ![BoxOfficeMojo.com]http://www.boxofficemojo.com/ is used to determine which film features (listed below) are most correlated with the sales.

Features: 

*Country
*Genre (Action/Drama/Comedy,etcâ€¦)
*Operating budget
*Runtime
*MPAA Ratings

Procedures:
Beautiful Soup 4 was used to scrape the film data from BoxOfficeMojo.com
Data was collected for almost 1,800 movies but several files had missing data for operating budget, genre and country.
